# Adminimize

This is the refactor branch, don't use it. But you can help on development.

We would create a new solution, important is the maintainance of the source code. So it is necessary that we remove, prevent redundant source code. Also we shoudl unittest for a lot of functions. The follow list helps to improve the plugin, other topics should we move, primarily the idea, from the current version inside the [master branch](https://github.com/bueltge/Adminimize/tree/master).

- [ ] Usage of https://github.com/Chrico/wp-fields for creating fields and his validation

      - Example: https://github.com/inpsyde/inpsyde-google-tag-manager/blob/master/src/Settings/View/TabbedSettingsPageView.php#L61
      - Create Fields Example https://github.com/inpsyde/inpsyde-google-tag-manager/blob/master/src/DataLayer/User/UserDataCollector.php#L133-L149

- [ ] Usage of https://github.com/Brain-WP/Nonces for OOP deal with WordPress Nonces
- [ ] Add Unittests 
- [ ] The settings page should use for each settings area - see #17
- [ ] Multisite usage - how we can realized this requirement; each option in each site is different?
